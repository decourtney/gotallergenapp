<h1>Privacy Policy for got allergen?</h1>
<p class="last-updated"><strong>Effective Date:</strong> January 1, 2025<br>
<strong>Last Updated:</strong> January 1, 2025</p>

<div class="disclaimer">
<strong>‚ö†Ô∏è Important Medical Disclaimer:</strong> got allergen? is an informational tool and should not be used as a substitute for reading product labels or medical advice. Always verify ingredients on physical product packaging before consuming any food item.
</div>

<p>got allergen? ("we," "our," "the App") is developed by an independent developer to help users identify potential allergens in food products. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our mobile application.</p>

<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

<h3>Information You Provide</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Allergen Preferences:</strong> The allergens you select to track are stored locally on your device only.</li>
<li><strong>Scan History:</strong> Barcodes you scan and search queries are stored locally on your device and are never uploaded to our servers.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Information Collected Automatically</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Camera Access:</strong> The App requires camera permission to scan product barcodes. Images are processed locally and are not stored or transmitted.</li>
<li><strong>Barcode Data:</strong> When you scan a barcode, it is sent to the Open Food Facts API to retrieve product information. We do not store or track which barcodes you scan.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
<ul>
<li>To match product ingredients against your selected allergen preferences</li>
<li>To display product information retrieved from Open Food Facts</li>
<li>To maintain your local scan history for your convenience</li>
<li>All processing happens locally on your device</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>

<h3>Open Food Facts</h3>
<p>The App uses the <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/" target="_blank">Open Food Facts</a> public API to retrieve food product data. When you scan a barcode, that barcode is sent to Open Food Facts to look up product information. Open Food Facts is a non-profit project. Review their <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/terms-of-use" target="_blank">Terms of Use</a> and <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/privacy-policy" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

<h3>Advertising (If Applicable)</h3>
<p>The App may display advertisements through <strong>Google AdMob</strong>. AdMob may collect certain information including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Device identifiers (Advertising ID)</li>
<li>IP address</li>
<li>General location (city/region level)</li>
<li>App usage data</li>
</ul>
<p>This data is collected and processed by Google according to their <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>. You can opt out of personalized advertising in your device settings.</p>

<h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
<ul>
<li>All user data (allergen preferences, scan history) is stored locally on your device using secure storage methods</li>
<li>We do not operate servers or databases that store your personal information</li>
<li>If you delete the App, all locally stored data is removed from your device</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>
<p>We do not sell, trade, or transfer your information to third parties. The only data shared externally is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Barcodes sent to Open Food Facts API for product lookup (anonymous)</li>
<li>Advertising data collected by AdMob (if ads are enabled)</li>
</ul>

<h2>6. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Access:</strong> You can view all your data (preferences and history) within the App</li>
<li><strong>Deletion:</strong> You can clear your scan history or delete all data by uninstalling the App</li>
<li><strong>Camera Access:</strong> You can revoke camera permissions in your device settings (this will prevent barcode scanning)</li>
<li><strong>Ad Personalization:</strong> You can opt out of personalized ads in your device settings</li>
</ul>

<h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>The App does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age. The App does not require account creation or collect any personally identifiable information. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us.</p>

<h2>8. International Users</h2>
<p>The App is available globally. If you use the App from outside the United States, please note that your barcode queries will be sent to Open Food Facts servers, which may be located in different countries.</p>

<h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

<ul>
<li>Updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy</li>

<li>Displaying an in-app notification (for material changes)</li>
</ul>
<p>Your continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
